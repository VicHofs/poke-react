This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Why SSR?
All the data will be pre-rendered via server side before the client side gets it, 
so that it improves the performance and experience when navigating the application.
You can check it out by simply disabling the javascript in your browser settings.
You'll still get the pre-rendered html and css files but the application won't be
able to interact with you, once it needs javascript to perform actions.


## Getting Started With Poke React SSR on Docker

First, clone the project 

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/hv90/poke-react.git && cd poke-react
```
Then let docker make all the service

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

_All data is pulled from the Pok√©Api API._

Use the search bar to look up a Pok√©mon‚Äîas of right now, searches need to match the Pok√©mon's name perfectly‚Äîand get its sprite, Pok√©Dex ID and description.
