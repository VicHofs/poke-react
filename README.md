## Why SSR (Server Side Rendering)?
All data will be pre-rendered by the server side before the client receives it, 
which improves the application's performance and the user experience.
You can see how this works by yourself by disabling JavaScript in your browser settings.
You'll still get the pre-rendered HTML and CSS files, but the application won't be interactive, since it needs live JavaScript for that purpose.


## :whale: Getting started with Pok√© React SSR on Docker

First, clone the project 

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/hv90/poke-react.git && cd poke-react
```
Then run `docker-compose`

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with a browser to see the result.


## üìù Project

A Pok√©Dex-like React app

[Click Here][website] to check it out!

<img alt="Pok√©Api" src="https://pokeapi.co/static/pokeapi_256.888baca4.png">

_All data is pulled from the Pok√©Api API._

Use the search bar to look up a Pok√©mon‚Äîas of right now, searches need to match the Pok√©mon's name perfectly‚Äîand get its sprite, Pok√©Dex ID and description.

There is support for multiple languages‚Äîspanning across different games‚Äîpertaining to descriptions.

Dark mode toggles automatically depending on the user's system preferences.
